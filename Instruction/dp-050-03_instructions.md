    }
    ```

1. Open **Notepad** and paste the command. Save the file into the **Labfiles** folder as **MapNetworkdrive.txt**.-->

Results: You have now successful created an Azure file share which will be used as a shared access location for SQL Server database backup files. In the next exercise you will configure the SQL instances to access the shared location.

## Exercise 3: Create a connection for the SQL Server instances to connect to the Azure file share

In this exercise, you will configure the SQL Server environment to access the Azure file share.

**Estimated Time:** 10 Minutes

The main tasks for this exercise are:

1. Register the file share through SQL Management Studio by mapping a network drive.
1. Connect to the file share.

### Register the server instances in SQL Management Studio

1. Sign into the **LON-DEV-01** virtual machine running in the classroom environment. The username is **administrator**, and the password is **Pa55w.rd**.
1. Start **SQL Management Studio**, and then connect to the local instance (LONDON).
1. In SQL Management Studio Object Explorer, select **Connect** and then select **Database Engine**.
1. In the **Connect to Server** dialog, enter these values and then select **Connect**:

    | Property | Value |
    | --- | --- |
    | Server name | Enter the fully qualified domain name or IP address of your SQL 2019 VM in Azure. For example: **sql2019vmxxx.centralus.cloudapp.azure.com** |
    | Authentication | SQL Server |
    | Login | sqladmin |
    | Password | Pa55w.rdPa55w.rd |

### Connect the SQL instances to the file shares

> [!NOTE]
> In order for SQL Server to be able to connect to a drive letter residing on a file share, you have to map the network drive by running `xp_cmdshell` in SQL Server Management Studio, so that the SQL service account can access the share. Data Migration Assistant uses the SQL service account to backup the database. For security reasons, command line access should be limited to SQL Server service accounts. By default SQL command line is disabled.

<!--1. Open the MapNetworkdrive.txt you created in the previous part of the exercise in Notepad, and the copy the text-->
1. In SQL Management Studio, in the **Object Explorer**, right-click the **LONDON** server and then select **New Query**.
<!--1. Paste the text from the MapNetworkdrive into the query window-->
<!--1. Enter this T-SQL code:

    ```sql
    SP_CONFIGURE 'show advanced options', 1
    RECONFIGURE
    SP_CONFIGURE 'xp_cmdshell', 1
    RECONFIGURE
    GO
    EXEC xp_cmdshell 'cmdkey /add:dp050storagexxxx.file.core.windows.net /user:Azure\dp050storagexxxx /pass:Mcty80xn7j'
    EXEC xp_cmdshell 'net use U: \\dp050storagexxxx.file.core.windows.net\backupshare /persistent:Yes'
    EXEC xp_cmdshell 'dir u:'
    ```
-->
<!-- The above is correct but you'll have to construct it from parameters. The command is of this form:

net use U: \\<storageaccountname>.file.core.windows.net\<sharename> /u:Azure\<storageaccountname> <storage account key>

e.g. net use P: \\dp050storageajm.file.core.windows.net\backupshare /u:Azure\dp050storageajm RNm/boKPwuAxCX2bFdE6p5gzD6F09swpohgHtJF/joCjxbyvUx/lWELsGghll5OA9mwi8raQP4o5dPWA4rTY7A==

So you can leave out the call to cmdkey.

 -->

1. Enter this Transact-SQL code:

    ```sql
    EXECUTE sp_configure 'show advanced options', 1;
    RECONFIGURE;
    EXECUTE sp_configure 'xp_cmdshell' 1;
    RECONFIGURE;
    GO
    EXECUTE xp_cmdshell 'net use U: \\<storageaccountname>.file.core.windows.net\backupshare /persistent:Yes /u:Azure\<storageaccountname> <storageaccountkey>';
    EXECUTE xp_cmdshell 'dir U:';
    ```

1. In the query text, replace `<storageaccountname>` with the name of the storage account you created earlier. The name must be entered in two places.
1. Replace `<storageaccountkey>` with the primary access key you recorded for the storage account.
1. Execute the query and validate that the network drive is accessible.
1. Save the query in the Labfiles folder as **MapNetworkDrive.sql**
1. Start a new query window and disable `xp_cmdshell` by running this query:

    ```sql
    EXECUTE sp_configure 'xp_cmdshell', 0;
    RECONFIGURE;
    ```

1. Close all the queries windows and don't save any files.
1. In the **Object Explorer**, right-click the SQL Server in Azure, and then select **Connect**.
1. In the **Connect to Server** dialog, in the **Password** textbox, type **Pa55w.rdPa55w.rd** and then select **Connect**.
1. On the **File** menu, select **Open/File** and then open the **MapNetworkDrive.sql** file that you saved above.
1. In the status bar at the bottom of the query window, check that you are connected to the Azure VM.
1. To map the U: drive on the Azure VM, execute the query and validate that the network drive is accessible.
1. Start a new query window and disable `xp_cmdshell` by running this query:

    ```sql
    EXECUTE sp_configure 'xp_cmdshell', 0;
    RECONFIGURE;
    ```

1. Close SQL Server Management Studio.

## Exercise 4: Perform a Database Migration using SQL Server Data
